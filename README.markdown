InternBot
=========
Originally hacked up with the primary purpose of annoying all the interns on the chat channel and the secondary purpose of providing some useful tools to expedite the ramp-up process.

Message me if you have any questions. If you're reading this, you have access to this private repo anyway, so feel free to commit changes as you see fit.
